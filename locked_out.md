## Setting Up a New Password
For your first login, you may choose any password. This password will be encrypted and stored in a file named "PASSWORD" within the ComfyUI project folder.

## Resetting a Forgotten Password
If you forget your password, you can reset it by deleting the "PASSWORD" file found in the ComfyUI project folder. After doing this, you will be able to log in again using a new password of your choice.

## Removing the Login Feature
To disable the login feature, you can either:

1. Use the [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) to uninstall it, or

2. Manually delete the ComfyUI-Login folder located in the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory. Then, restart ComfyUI for the changes to take effect.
